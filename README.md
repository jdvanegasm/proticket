# ProTicket

## Description
ProTicket is a lightweight web application for publishing events and selling digital tickets.  
It provides:
- A clear buyer flow to discover events, pay via a single provider, and receive QR/PDF tickets with email confirmation.
- A simple organizer experience to create/publish events and view basic sales metrics (sold, remaining, gross, fees) with CSV export.
- Minimal, reliable foundations: general admission (no seat maps), consistent capacity control (decrease only on Paid), UTC storage with event-timezone display, and a static Help/FAQ for support.

> Quick demo path: Sign up → Browse event → Choose quantity → Pay → Open “My Tickets” → Download QR/PDF.
